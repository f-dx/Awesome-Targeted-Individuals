# Awesome Remote Neural Monitoring

The largest collection of available materials for self-defence and legal response against covert tortures using Covert Neural Interfaces. 

** The information requires facts verification. The research is in progress. **

## What is Remote Neural Monitoring?

A brain-computer interface (BCI), also known as a brain-machine interface (BMI), is a technology that enables direct communication between the brain's electrical activity and external devices, primarily computers. BCIs are designed to research, map, assist, augment, or alter human cognitive and sensory-motor functions, bypassing traditional neuromuscular pathways.

What are illegal BCI. What is neural terrorism?

### Neural Terrorism Definition:
"The deliberate misuse of neurotechnology and brain-computer interfaces to cause harm, manipulate neural functions, or exploit brain data for malicious purposes against individuals or groups."

Common Security Risks:
- Unauthorized access to neural data
- Brain tampering/hacking 
- Privacy breaches
- Signal interference
- Malicious neural patterns injection
- Social Engineering attacks
- Tools for remote torture


A technology that is used for multiple purposes:

1. SURVEILLANCE & MONITORING
- Remote neural activity monitoring
- Body telemetry collection 24/7
- Real-time EEG data collection
- Full vision and audio capture

2. COGNITIVE CONTROL
- Access to language centers (Broca's area)
- Thought suppression/injection
- Memory alteration capabilities 
- Attention/focus control
- Consciousness modification
- Dream/sleep pattern modulation
- Neural social networking

3. SENSORY & PHYSICAL MANIPULATION 
- Audio/visual/tactile hallucinations
- Muscle control interface
- Visual cortex manipulation
- Body hijacking capabilities
- Remote body control
- Pain/pleasure center modulation
- Hormonal system control

4. MEDICAL & EMERGENCY
- Neurological disorder simulation
- Emergency assistance functions
- Coma state induction
- Hearth attack capability (120-200ms)
- Neuro-modulation of brain functions

## Mechanism of action: possible explanation and reverse-engineering

Unfortunately, there is no common scientifically proven mechanism of action available in Targeted Individuals community.

However, here are top 5 hypotheses of how it can work:

1. Self-assembly (graphene-oxide-based nanoparticles)
2. CRISPR-Cas9 DNA modification and combination of supportive mechanisms
3. Altered bioagents, such as parasites, bacteria, bacteriophages, and single-cell parasites (like Toxoplasma), and combinations of them
4. Neuroprosthetics delivered using an unknown mechanism of action
5. Micro-implants (dental and other simple ways of delivery)

## How to protect yourself?

- Avoid dental anaesthetics
- Avoid vaccines
- Avoid any Big Pharma injections
- Avoid food and bevereges from large holdings and corporations
- Isolate fully your head from RF while sleeping using conductive materials
- Limit GSM/LTE/5G/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth exposure (fully isolate yourself and monitor 24x7)
- Eat organic, non-processed food, drink only verified water, use water filters
- Use air filters at home to protect yourself from neural dust
- Use N95 mask in public places
- Regularly wash your hands
- Other unknown strategies

## How to deactivate? 

- Isolation / Protection
- EMF fields
- RF fields
- Vibration
- Ultra Sound
- Immune system stimulation
- TENS electroestimulation
- Chemical / Pharmacology ways
- Physical activities
- Locate and disable in-wall emitters (using thermal cameras and RF scanners like HackRF)
- RNM programming and control via default gestures interface (easiest one when you are not a Targeted Individual)
- Mixed approaches
- Other unknown methods

## Activation mechanism

## 1. Rental properties and hotels

The Global Government is using black budgets and fake identities to buy properties near rental objects, which they then use as bases for local RNM operations. 
They basically have a presence in about 30-70% (a rough estimate) of hotels in Spain, for example. 
Platforms like Booking.com, Airbnb, and Idealista are used to redirect individuals to specific locations, which are totally controlled by local agents and equipped with RNM tuning equipment.

## 2. In-wall built-in devices in hotels and apartments (high density near roofs)

Local RNM (Remote Neural Monitoring) controllers, also known as hubs, are located near more than 60% of rental properties. They utilize a range of frequencies, including the 450-1250 MHz RF spectrum and the 2400-2500 MHz RF spectrum, as well as ultrasound and arrays of sound emitters for V2K (Voice to Skull) and psychological operations.

## How signal is delivered / communication channels

- Wi-FI (any wi-fi router), Bluetooth (any bluetooth device)
- Cellular Mobile Networks: GSM, 3G, LTE, 5G
- Satellites arrays (likely low orbit)
- Ultrasound
- Probably visual channel (optical nerve stimulation): via hidden patterns using LCD screens (iOS, Androoid, MacOS devices)
- Other unknown methods: area to explore further
