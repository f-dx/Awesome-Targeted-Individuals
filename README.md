## Before start

- False triggers and misrepresentation
  
Gangstalking can involve false triggers and misrepresentation. Simple anxiety disorders or coincidences can be mistakenly seen as attacks. It's essential to recognize that normal events can occur naturally and may not be related to gangstalking. Be cautious of misinterpreting everyday experiences.

- Quick mental health check-up and integrity assurance
  
Regular mental health check-ups are crucial for maintaining well-being. Consider taking a quick screening test like the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) or the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess your mental state. Additionally, integrity assurance can be evaluated through self-reflection and tools like the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). These checks can help identify potential issues and promote mental wellness.
  
- Check for medical issues (anxiety triggers)

Anxiety can be triggered by various medical issues and natural factors. It's essential to rule out underlying conditions that may be contributing to anxiety. Some medical issues to consider include: Thyroid disorders, Heart problems, Diabetes, Sleep disorders.
Additionally, certain substances and toxins can naturally raise anxiety levels, such as: Caffeine and nicotine, Heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury), Pesticides and insecticides, Certain medications (e.g., steroids, stimulants)

- Talk to Psychotherapist

Don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional for support. They can provide a safe and confidential space to discuss your concerns and work through challenges.

You have a good chance to survive and thrive. Now, we have more than five strong organizations that are fighting against this organized criminal syndicate. We are not alone; we have strong support from within governments. We have the right to be heard, to be protected, and to receive compensation for the harm done to our lives, our freedom, and our families.

## General information and FAQ

- Who is behind Targeted Individuals program?

Carl Clark, who was a freelancer from 1980 to 2003 for different Secret Services, confirms that the US CIA is in fact a state run domestic terrorist organization that does illegal torture operations on citizens to drive them crazy, make them suicidal, and discredit them. Here is the quote: "I worked for the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) up to 1997...  My operational area was Europe: Paris, Zurich, Berlin, Dusseldorf, Munich, Madrid, Lyons, Bilbao and Moscow... I tracked individual targets for the CIA. I had orders to confuse or deceive them.Unfortunately, the deployment of microwave weapons has become very practicable. I was responsible for surveillance. **Colleagues from special departments did this.** However, I was at times on site when these weapons were deployed. The radar emits electromagnetic waves, some of which pick up the target and the result is then evaluated. My friends who work in the special department could then follow the target all day on their computers. This form of localising the target made it easy to deploy the weapons accurately. My colleagues could see exactly where to aim and also observe how the target reacted. They create heat, inner burns, pain, nausea, fear. Sometimes traces are left on the skin, but mostly not.
The aim is to intimidate certain people, for example people who make a lot of noise. I myself was under attack for three years after opting out. The undoubted goal is to have select people end up in psychiatric institutions. If a target seeks help by going to the police or to the doctor, they don’t get taken seriously. Some doctors and hospitals actually work together with the Secret Services.
...I penetrated secretly into houses, took away things or shifted one or others. I extinguished data on their computer. Or I unnerved these people, while I pursued them, appeared over and over again in their nearness, at the bus stop, in the railway station etc. Or we threaded a fight on street which takes then place before the eyes of this person and others. If somebody should be put under pressure even more or should be arrested, I also pulled certain contents on his computer as for example child-pornographic contents or a management to the production of a bomb etc... State also supplies FBI – agents for industrial spying matters. The Freemasons from whom there are many in the CIA also play a big role in this wetting. "

A former high-level FBI official (the late Ted L. Gunderson) publicly claiming that “gang stalking” is simply a more sophisticated version of COINTELPRO.

Quote: "**They have the technology, financing and manpower to dispense illegal surveillance and harassment against anyone at any time, day or night.** I have files on numerous cases of active, programmatic, illegal government harassment currently being conducted against thousands of Americans. **This makes the F.B.I.'s former COINTELPRO program, which I worked on, including in a supervisory capacity, look like a Sunday school program by comparison**...

I firmly believe that most individuals working in the F.B.I., other intelligence agencies, and the government overall are honest, law-abiding public servants. However, **a sophisticated network of rogue operatives has secretly infiltrated the F.B.I., other intelligence agencies including the C.I.A., and other key government positions**...

This rogue element **seeks personal power and wealth and considers themselves above the law and the Constitution**. They are carrying out the aforementioned **surveillance and harassment activities in conjunction with organized crime**, the cult movement in America including **Satanic cults**, other **commercial and political interests**, and even misguided civic organizations and neighborhood groups." - Ted L. Gunderson

This illegal surveillance and harassment program is being called **gang stalking and organized stalking** by the victims targeted by it.

- Why it still exists?

Journalist George Webb estimates that today there are over 20 times more undercover government agents operating than during the height of the Vietnam war when the FBIs COINTELPRO and CIA’s MHCHAOS operations were running and spying on Americans. 
Since 9/11, **over $8 trillion of public money** has been transferred from social programs to the National Security Enterprise (aka “Top Secret America”) from Valentine, D. (2017).
  
## How to stop Targeted Individuals program?

- Legal resistance, lawsuits: require strong systematic scientific evidence (at least 450 pages of proof, like in James Walbert's case)
- Social movements and protests: easier to organize, but usually not well-attended, therefore don't make a lot of sense
- OSINT research and exposure of gangstalkers (contributing to open-source repositories like this)
- Proactive letters with related questions to high-stake officials
- Active exposure through posting and re-posting on social networks
- Distributing information flyers and booklets: inform street participants about the harm caused by their actions
- Prayer and popularization of Christianity, as the roots of gangstalking are tightly connected with [Satanism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0MLtcjV0q0)

## Connection with Illuminati

"... It was some Time since that a Book fell into my Hands entituled “Proofs of a Conspiracy &c. by John Robison, which gives a full Account of a Society of Freemasons, that distinguishes itself by the Name “of Illuminati,” whose Plan is to overturn all Government and all Religion, even natural; and who endeavour to eradicate every Idea of a Supreme Being, and distinguish Man from Beast by his Shape only. A Thought suggested itself to me, that some of the Lodges in the United States might have caught the Infection, and might cooperate with the Illuminati or the Jacobine Club in France. Fauchet is mentioned by Robison as a zealous Member: and who can doubt of Genet and Adet? Have not these their Confidants in this Country? They use the same Expressions and are generally Men of no Religion. Upon serious Reflection I was led to think that it might be within your Power to prevent the horrid Plan from corrupting the Brethren of the English Lodge over which you preside. " To George Washington from G. W. Snyder, 22 August 1798

"I have heard much of the nefarious, & dangerous plan, & doctrines of the Illuminati, but never saw the Book until you were pleased to send it to me..." - Washington

Several people have come forward as Illuminati whistleblowers, sharing detailed but controversial stories about their alleged involvement in a secretive, powerful group. These accounts often include claims of rituals, political control, and plans for a New World Order. While fascinating, these claims are debated and lack mainstream verification, so it's important to consider them critically.

**Forced Participation in Secret Societies**: Fritz Springmeier claims individuals are coerced into joining secret societies like the Illuminati through blackmail, threats, or mind control, violating their freedom to choose their associations and beliefs.

**Mind Control Programming Violates Free Will**: Springmeier alleges that global elites, including the Illuminati, use sophisticated mind control techniques (e.g., Monarch programming) to strip individuals of autonomy, forcing them to act against their will through trauma-based conditioning. This undermines freedom of choice by creating “programmed slaves” who cannot make independent decisions.

**Forced Labor in Covert Operations**: Springmeier alleges that mind-controlled individuals are used as operatives (e.g., assassins, spies) without consent, constituting forced labor and violating their right to choose their work.


## RNM (Remote Neural Monitoring)

Advanced brain control technology mind control for the masses, no implant needed.
There is no credible scientific evidence or public information to support the existence of a technology,
known as "remote neural monitoring" being used to track targeted individuals.
